* ZoomFields and LookupFields -- cloning the table for new EntityModel
** The LookupField only has a dependency on the id field in its own table, so sql_Table.clone() can handle it
** ZoomField does not depend on the referencedIdField's value, so it does not need to be updated to the cloned table
** The problem would only arise if we depend on a _value_ in another table, then we'd have to update the reference, and thus know about it in the referenced field

* 2017-07-06: The client MUST know which fields are mandatory, so it can send the save() request for a new record only after they have all been filled
